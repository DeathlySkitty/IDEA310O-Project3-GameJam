# Game Ideas

## What I'm looking at

**My IDEA**

I am hoping that I can create a world where you can have multiple things to do.  My inspiration is VRChat and all the different kinds of worlds that you can visit and explore.  I am hoping to create a dynamic world where you can either chill and explore the environment, perform side quests, play a game, or watch videos with your friends.  I want my world to have interactables, pretty visuals, comfy vibes, etc..

Talked to teacher and he said it's perfectly fine if I want to have a "carnival, interaction" type game.

I need to start talking to my gamer friends so we can come up with ideas for what we want in the world.

* Virtual Reality (VR)
* VRChat World
* 3D


**Questions**

1. What kind of vibe am I looking for?
2. What kind of design?
3. What should the theme of the world be?
4. What kind of games should I intigrate?
5. What kind of comfyness am I looking for?
6. What can I Personally design / design with friends?
7. What can I use that I don't design?
8. Should there be mini games in the world?
9. How to intigrate the videoplayer in the world?
10.

**Notes**

1. Set the bar low because you only have 7 weeks
2. Be able to create an environment but also the functionality of the game

**IDEA**

What if I created a VRChat world that is like a base for my online gamer group.  I created a comfy place that represents or at least has at least one thing that represents the group and each person individually.  Created a base of operations in a way.

What if I created a cute little modern cabin with comfy and relaxing vibes.  Just listen and explore the world.  Listen to the sound of the water, rain, little animals here and there.  Be able to pickup plushies (interactables).  Create a room that is a gettogether.  Create a space that feels relaxing.  I'm getting water, forest, and cabin vibes.

**Interactables**

* Plushies
* Ball or spool of yarn
* Markers
* Food
* Games
* Objects
